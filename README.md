# Fixing
 A GGJ game

Hi, this game was made for GlobalGameJam 2020, the topic of which was missing was "repair"
Well, the name of the game was called From Productions To Explotions. As a player, you will have to fix every damaged bombers with cola cans, bathroom tissue and wood planks!

Apparerently, the earlier version (released during GGJ) of the game have more bugs. But to our surprise, a developer have fixed the raycast bug reacently and he decided to continue updating the game for a while! What's more, he chose to release the soursecode so other developers may have a chance to update(or simply play) the game.

The project requires unity engine(version 2019.3.0f6), using unity hdrp, unity probuilder and a few free assets from the asset store.

Not open for commercial use.
